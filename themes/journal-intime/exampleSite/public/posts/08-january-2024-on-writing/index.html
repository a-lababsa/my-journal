        <h1 id="why-do-we-write">Why do we write?</h1>
<p>This morning I woke up with words already forming in my mind, like they&rsquo;d been composing themselves while I slept. It made me think about why any of us put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) when no one has asked us to.</p>
<h2 id="the-archaeology-of-thoughts">The archaeology of thoughts</h2>
<p>Writing feels like excavation sometimes. You start with a vague sense of something buried—a feeling, a memory, an observation that won&rsquo;t let go—and then you dig. Each word is a small shovel-full of dirt, and gradually something emerges.</p>
<p><em>Often it&rsquo;s not what you expected to find.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-conversation-with-yourself">The conversation with yourself</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s you-who-writes and you-who-reads-what-you-wrote, and they&rsquo;re having a conversation across time. Sometimes they disagree. Sometimes one surprises the other.</p>
<p>Today they seem to be in harmony, which is why this feels so effortless.</p>
<h2 id="permission-to-be-imperfect">Permission to be imperfect</h2>
<p>The best writing happens when you stop trying to write well and just try to write truly. When you give yourself permission to be awkward, redundant, overly sentimental, or painfully honest.</p>
<p><em>Perfect prose is often perfectly forgettable.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for this space, these words, this ongoing conversation with myself and whoever might stumble upon these thoughts and recognize something of their own experience in them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the miracle of writing, isn&rsquo;t it? That we can feel less alone through the act of articulating our aloneness.</p>
