There's something about the night that makes thoughts more honest. Less filtered. 

The world feels smaller at this hour—just me, this pen, these words finding their way onto paper. Or in this case, onto a glowing screen that feels surprisingly intimate.

I wonder about the stories we tell ourselves about who we are. How much of it is performance, even when no one's watching?

*In the darkness, pretense seems pointless.*

Tomorrow I'll probably overthink this entry, wonder if it's too revealing, too raw. But right now, in this quiet space, it feels exactly right.
