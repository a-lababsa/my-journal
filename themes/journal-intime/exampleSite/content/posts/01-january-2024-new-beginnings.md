Today feels different. There's something in the air—maybe it's just the arbitrary turning of a calendar page, but I choose to see it as an invitation.

*New beginnings don't have to be dramatic. Sometimes they're as quiet as deciding to pay attention.*

I've been thinking about what it means to be gentle with myself this year. Not in a permissive way, but with the kind of tenderness we show to things that are growing.

The morning light through my window looks golden today. I'll take that as a good sign.
