# When feelings are messier than words

Today the anxiety came back like an unwelcome but familiar visitor. That tightness in my chest, the racing thoughts, the way even simple decisions feel overwhelming.

I used to fight it, try to logic my way out of it, pretend it wasn't there. Now I'm learning something different: **how to make space for it.**

## The practice of sitting still

- Noticing without judging
- Breathing without fixing
- Allowing without surrendering

*Maybe healing isn't about getting rid of difficult emotions. Maybe it's about expanding enough to hold them with kindness.*

The feeling will pass, as they always do. But for now, I'm trying to be curious about it rather than ashamed of it.

That feels like growth, even when it doesn't feel good.
