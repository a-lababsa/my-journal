# Images Required for Hugo Themes Submission

This directory must contain two images for the official Hugo themes gallery:

1. **screenshot.png** - Main preview image (1500Ã—1000 pixels)

## How to create these images

1. Start the Hugo server:

   hugo server
   ```

2. Take screenshots of the theme in action:
   - Homepage with journal entries
   - Individual post view
   - Dark mode toggle in action
   - Mobile responsive view

3. Use a tool like:
   - macOS: Screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4)
   - Browser developer tools for specific dimensions
   - Online image resizing tools

4. Ensure the images show:
   - Clean, attractive design
   - Key features (dark mode, typography, layout)
   - Real content (not placeholder text)
   - Professional presentation
